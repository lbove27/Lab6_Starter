For a first time baker with a family legacy of turning cupcakes into tarts (they never rose, and always came out rock-hard), I was genuinely surprised at how well my batch came out: very professional looking too! :D\r\nI had yogurt that was going a bit sour, so I diluted that with water (3/4 water for every 1/4 yogurt) instead of using buttermilk. I'm really happy with them, and they're soft and moist a week later too.

The cupcake flavour is strong and so easy to make. I did the recipe with gluten-free flour and they came out very moist and tasty (I would just be wary of overbaking).
