Can't use my oven right now so I thought I'd have them make the boo bark. Ages 13 &amp; 10 and the four of them had a fabulous time making the bark and decorating it. It was ready before the girls left. My one daughter tried it and told me it tastes great. How could it not? :) Thank you so much!!\r\n\r\nI used Baker's chocolate and used 6 oz of chocolate and 4 oz of white chocolate just to make sure there was enough of a base for 4 square plates so they each had their own.

My only problem with it was that it was melting as I was breaking it apart.  I followed the directions and it was in the refrigerator for about an hour for it to set.  Then the next day (after being in the refrigerator), it was messy to eat as the chocolate was starting to melt and was getting on your fingers.   What did I do wrong?  I was hoping to give these out in separate bags to the grandkids, but it the chocolate gets all over your fingers."}],"datePublished":"2019-10-21","@id":"https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/easy-halloween-recipes/#recipe","isPartOf":{"@id":"https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/easy-halloween-recipes/#article"},"mainEntityOfPage":"https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/easy-halloween-recipes/#webpage"}]}
