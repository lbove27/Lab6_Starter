If using a stand mixer, make sure you pause periodically to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a spatula so that all ingredients are evenly incorporated.\nWith mixer on low speed, gradually add lightly beaten eggs, one at a time, stirring just until each egg is incorporated (don\u2019t over-beat the cheesecake batter at this point, it\u2019s a sure way to end up with cracks!). Once all eggs have been added, use a spatula to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl again and make sure all ingredients are well combined.\nPour cheesecake batter into prepared springform pan. To insure against leaks, place pan on a cookie sheet that\u2019s been lined with foil.\nTransfer to oven and bake on 325F (160C) for 75 minutes. Edges should have slightly puffed and may have just begun to turn a light golden brown and the center should spring back to the touch but will still be Jello-jiggly.\nRemove from oven and allow to cool on top of the oven** for 10 minutes. Once 10 minutes has passed, use a knife to gently loosen the crust from the inside of the springform pan (this will help prevent cracks as your cheesecake cools and shrinks).\nAllow cheesecake to cool another 1-2 hours or until near room temperature before transferring to refrigerator and allowing to cool overnight or at least 6 hours.\nEnjoy!\n\nNotes\n\n*Make sure that you use the brick-style cream cheese, not the spreadable version that is available in tubs. **I recommend the top of the oven because it is usually the warmest place in my house (after it\u2019s been on for over an hour). This will help to cool the cheesecake more gradually and will also help avoid cracks).","uploadDate":"2019-01-30T15:30:00+00:00","duration":"PT8M7S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/O1fTQ_5dBw0/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1fTQ_5dBw0","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/O1fTQ_5dBw0?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["12","12 slices"],"prepTime":"PT20M","cookTime":"PT75M","totalTime":"PT455M","recipeIngredient":["1 \u00bd cups  graham cracker crumbs ((170g))","2 Tablespoons sugar","1 Tablespoon brown sugar ((can substitute white))","7 Tablespoons butter (melted)","32 oz cream cheese\u00b2 (softened to room temperature (910g))","1 cup sugar ((200g))","\u2154 cups sour cream ((160g))","1 \u00bd teaspoons vanilla extract","\u215b teaspoon salt","4  large eggs (room temperature, lightly beaten)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Preheat oven to 325F (160C).","name":"Preheat oven to 325F (160C).","url":"https://sugarspunrun.com/best-cheesecake-recipe/#wprm-recipe-15637-step-0-0"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Prepare Graham Cracker crust first by combining graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and brown sugar, and stirring well.
